# User Story 

As a disgruntled programmer
I WANT to save funny jokes
SO THAT I can laugh at them later

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a webpage with a pair of dice on them
WHEN I click the dice 
THEN a random number of jokes appears
WHEN I like a joke
THEN I can save it for later to look at
WHEN I want to look at the joke
THEN I can switch to my saved jokes webpage
WHEN I no longer find a joke funny/need space for new jokes (up to 50)
THEN I can delete the joke out of my saved jokes webpage
