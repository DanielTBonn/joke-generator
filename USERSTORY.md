# User Story 

As a funny guy
I WANT to save funny jokes
SO THAT I can laugh at them later when i'm down

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a webpage with a pair of dice on them
WHEN I click the dice 
THEN a random number of jokes appears
WHEN I like a joke
THEN I can save it for later to look at
WHEN I want to look at the joke
THEN I can switch to my saved jokes webpage
WHEN I no longer find a joke funny/need space for new jokes (up to 50)
THEN I can delete the joke out of my saved jokes webpage

## Notes

For the web pages we will want to be able to click back and forth to see old saved jokes and generate new ones, so we will need a navbar with links to and from
On the joke generator webpage we will want to see all the jokes pop up and the previous jokes dissappear when you click the generator button, AND you will want 
to save those jokes to localStorage.
On the old joke viewer page, we will want to view all of the old jokes, and we will want to be able to delete them.
